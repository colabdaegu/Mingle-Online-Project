IMPORTANT: Please backup your project before using this tool. 
    I've never lost any data using this tool, but I don't want to be responsible for any data loss during the process.
    (It is also a good habit to backup your project from time to time or to simply use a source control.)

Supported Assets:

Scene:
    What it does:
        - Creates a World asset
        - Adds a SkyLight to simulate Unity's default lighting
        - Adds all the actors (Including display name, transform, visibility and tag)
        - Recreates the scene's hierarchy
        - Supports instance edited materials on static mesh actors
    Limitations:
        - If your scenes contain non-uniform scaling on any parent of a rotated mesh, the result will not be as expected in Unreal because of the way the meshes are transformed.
            Example of the difference between the two engines: https://youtu.be/kdM9UWolEj4
        - Bad hierarchy examples:
            Scene root -> Non-uniformly scaled object -> Rotated mesh
            Scene root -> Non-uniformly scaled object -> Uniformly scaled object -> Rotated mesh
            Scene root -> Non-uniformly scaled object -> Rotated object -> Not rotated mesh
        - Good hierarchy examples:
            Scene root -> Uniformly scaled object -> Rotated mesh
            Scene root -> Non-uniformly scaled object -> Not rotated mesh
            Scene root -> Uniformly scaled object -> Not rotated mesh

Prefab:
    What it does:
        - Creates a Blueprint Actor asset
        - Adds all the components (Including display name, transform, visibility and tag)
        - Recreates the prefab's hierarchy
        - Supports instance edited materials on static mesh components
        - Supports nested prefabs (child actor components)
    Limitations:
        - If your prefabs contain non-uniform scaling on any parent of a rotated mesh, the result will not be as expected in Unreal because of the way the meshes are transformed.
            Example of the difference between the two engines: https://youtu.be/kdM9UWolEj4
        - Bad hierarchy examples:
            Prefab root -> Non-uniformly scaled object -> Rotated mesh
            Prefab root -> Non-uniformly scaled object -> Uniformly scaled object -> Rotated mesh
            Prefab root -> Non-uniformly scaled object -> Rotated object -> Not rotated mesh
        - Good hierarchy examples:
            Prefab root -> Uniformly scaled object -> Rotated mesh
            Prefab root -> Non-uniformly scaled object -> Not rotated mesh
            Prefab root -> Uniformly scaled object -> Not rotated mesh

Static Mesh:
    What it does:
        - Creates a Static Mesh asset
        - Assigns the materials to the mesh
        - Supports .fbx or .obj files with more than one mesh
        - Uses FBX Exporter to generate .fbx files for meshes that are from different sources
    Limitations:
        - I don't have much control over FBX Exporter so the exports of .asset files aren't the best. (location, rotation & scale issues)
        - The materials ID are sometime swapped during import

Skeletal Mesh:
    What it does:
        - Creates a Skeletal Mesh asset
        - Assigns the materials to the mesh
        - Uses FBX Exporter to generate .fbx files for meshes that are from different sources
    Limitations: 
        - Rig may not be supported by Unreal. (Not a limitation of Utu, but of Unreal compared to Unity)
        - The materials ID are sometime swapped during import

Animation:
    What it does:
        - Imports Animation assets
        - Link them to the desired Skeleton
        - Apply animation overrides on Skeletal Meshes in the Level (or Blueprint)
        - Uses FBX Exporter to generate .fbx files for meshes that are from different sources
    Limitations: 
        - Can only link the Animation to the proper Skeletal Mesh if they're linked through an Animator component in a Scene (or Prefab)
        - Only supports 1 animation per .fbx file
        - Doesn't create Animation Blueprints
        - Animation import transform isn't always good. You can customize it using the "Import Settings" tab in the Utu Plugin window.

Texture:
    What it does:
        - Creates a Texture2D asset using the texture file
    Limitations: 
        - .tif files are not supported (Not a limitation of Utu, but of Unreal compared to Unity)

        - Sets all the parameters and textures into the material

        - Standard
        - Standard (Specular setup)

        - ShaderGraphs_PhysicalMaterial3DsMax
        - ShaderGraphs_PhysicalMaterial3DsMaxTransparent

        - ShaderGraphs_VFXSpriteUnlit
    Limitations: 
        - Equivalence is not 100% perfect
        - Custom shaders (and shaders not in this list) are not supported, but the tool will still import all the parameters in Unreal and create a basic material graph.
